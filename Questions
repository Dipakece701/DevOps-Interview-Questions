Have you ever created any certificate ? Yes, through openssl command
The commands below can be used to view the certificate fingerprint/thumbprint.
• SHA-256: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt] 
• SHA-1: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt]
• MD5: openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -md5 -inform pem -in [certificate-file.crt] 

What is the demerits and merits while creating a certificate by our own ?
Advantages
1. No PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is needed.
2. Automatic deployment (Usually Self-signed certificates created automatic during the installation process of the server side applications).
Disadvantages
1. The certificates aren’t trusted by other applications/operating systems. This may lead to authentications errors etc.
Note: To overcome this limitation, some IT staff add the self-signed certificates to the Trusted Roots Certificate Authorities. However, using this workaround may to additional time that needed for management and troubleshooting.
2. Self-signed certificates life time is usually 1 years. Before the year is ended, the certificate may need to renew/replace.
3. Self-signed certificates may use low hash and cipher technologies. Due this, the security level that implemented by self-signed certificates may not satisfy the current Security Policy etc. .
4. No support for advanced PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) functions (e.g. Online checking of the revocation list etc.).
5. Most of the advanced feathers of the server side applications required to impended a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). By this, self-signed certificates advantages can't be used.

What is ca-certificates  and in which Algorithm it worked ?
CA certificates can also be used to establish trust relationships between CAs in two different public key infrastructure (PKI) hierarchies.
Root CA Certificate 
	Issuing CA Certificate
		User Certificate
The following are some of the trust scenarios that can be enabled by properly configured CA certificates:
	• Simple trust within an enterprise PKI
	• Cross trust between two enterprise CAs (restricted)
	• Bridge trust for multiple enterprise PKIs (unrestricted)
	• Certificate trust continuity when the certificate policy changes
